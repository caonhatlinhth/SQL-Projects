# SQL-Projects

Welcome to my SQL Class Repository! This is the central hub for all coursework, projects, and learning resources from my journey into the world of SQL (Structured Query Language). Throughout this course, I used various tools and platforms to learn and practice SQL, which is the standard language for managing and manipulating relational databases.

One of the primary tools I used was MySQL, an open-source relational database management system, where I executed diverse SQL queries to manage databases. Additionally, I also gained exposure to PostgreSQL, another powerful, open-source object-relational database system known for its extensibility and SQL compliance.

This repository took me through the fundamentals of SQL, starting with simple queries and advancing to more complex concepts like joins, subqueries, and aggregate functions. I learned how to create, modify, and delete tables and databases. I also got a deep understanding of the intricacies of database design, including concepts like normalization and denormalization.

**What's Inside**

Here you'll find:
- Lecture Notes: These are my personal notes from each lecture, summarizing the key points and concepts.
- Assignments: This directory contains the SQL assignments given during the class. Each assignment has a brief description, the SQL queries used to solve the problem, and my reflections on the challenges I faced and how I solved them.
- Projects: Here you'll find larger, more complex SQL projects that involve creating, populating, and querying databases.
- Resources: This section includes additional materials and resources I've found helpful for understanding SQL, such as links to tutorials, blog posts, documentation, and books.
